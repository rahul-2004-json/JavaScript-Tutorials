// JavaScript is an asynchronous language but its defualt behaviour is synchronous . We have to forcefully tell it to be asynchronous 

//JavaScript is synchronous and single threaded by default: every line of code 
// is executed one after the other, and each task must wait for the previous one to be completed before moving to the next


// Blocking code                                                         Non Blocking Code
//Blocks the flow of program                                            //Does not blocks the execution of code , other processes keep on executing until one completes and comesback
//eg: Read a file Synchronously                                         //Read file Asynchronously


//JS engine is made up of Memory Heap and Call Stack
//JS engine being single threaded is supported by web api and if environment given then its node
